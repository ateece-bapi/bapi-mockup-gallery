# WAM Mockups — Next.js + TypeScript

This repo contains two HTML mockups converted into a small Next.js (React + TypeScript) preview app.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the index and preview pages.

Notes

- This is a minimal conversion for preview and review. Further work to make the pages production-ready:
  - Add accessibility improvements (focus states, ARIA roles for tabs)
  - Extract components and add unit tests
  - Add real assets and replace placeholder content
