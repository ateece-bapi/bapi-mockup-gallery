# BAPI Website Mockup Gallery — Next.js + TypeScript

This project is a modern, senior-level mockup gallery and review hub for the BAPI website, built with Next.js (React + TypeScript).

## Features & Improvements

- **Senior-level UI/UX polish:** Dramatic hero header, strong branding, responsive layout, and advanced CSS for visual impact
- **Font migration:** Faithful port of Acumin (Adobe Fonts) and Roboto (Google Fonts) for brand consistency
- **Font comparison utility:** Instantly compare Acumin and Roboto with live controls for size and weight
- **Accessibility:** Improved focus states, semantic markup, and ARIA roles (ongoing)
- **Code cleanup:** Removal of duplicate styles, strict font variant usage, and maintainable component structure
- **Preview and review:** Easily compare multiple mockup and landing page variations

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
2. Run the development server
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the gallery and preview pages.

## Contributing & Review

## Notes
